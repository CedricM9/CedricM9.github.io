  <strong>Privacy Policy</strong>
  <p>This privacy policy applies to the Factor36 app (hereinafter referred to as "Application") for mobile devices, developed by Cedric Maume (hereinafter referred to as "Service Provider") as an ad-supported service. This service is provided "AS IS".</p>

  <br><strong>What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?</strong>

  <br><strong>User Provided Information</strong>
  <p>The Application does not require any registration, and no personal information is collected, stored, or transmitted by the Service Provider. All game data is stored locally on the userâ€™s device.</p>

  <br><strong>Automatically Collected Information</strong>
  <p>The Application itself does not collect any automatically generated data such as device type, IP address, or operating system. However, third-party services integrated into the Application may collect such information as part of their operations. These third-party services are listed below with links to their respective privacy policies.</p>

  <br><strong>Does the Application collect precise real-time location information of the device?</strong>
  <p>The Application does not collect precise real-time location information.</p>

  <br><strong>Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by the Application?</strong>
  <p>The Application integrates third-party services that may collect and process data as per their privacy policies. These services include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play Services</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AdMob</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/app-store" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">App Store Services</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>The Service Provider does not have access to or control over any data collected by these third-party services.</p>

  <br><strong>What are my opt-out rights?</strong>
  <p>Users can stop all data collection by uninstalling the Application. The standard uninstall process available on mobile devices or app stores can be used to remove the Application from the device.</p>

  <br><strong>Data Retention Policy, Managing Your Information</strong>
  <p>No personal or gameplay-related data is collected or stored by the Service Provider. Data collected by third-party services is managed according to their respective data retention policies.</p>

  <br><strong>Children</strong>
  <p>The Application is not intended for children under the age of 13. No personal information is knowingly collected from children under 13 years of age. Parents or guardians who believe their child may have provided personal information to a third-party service through the Application should contact the third-party service directly.</p>

  <br><strong>Security</strong>
  <p>The Service Provider does not process or store user data and therefore does not implement security measures related to personal data. Third-party services integrated into the Application apply their own security measures to protect any data they collect.</p>

  <br><strong>Changes</strong>
  <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any updates will be posted on this page, and the effective date will be revised accordingly. Continued use of the Application constitutes acceptance of any changes to this policy.</p>
  <p>This privacy policy is effective as of 2025-01-31</p>

  <br><strong>Your Consent</strong>
  <p>By using the Application, you consent to the handling of information as described in this Privacy Policy, including any processing performed by third-party services.</p>
